She reports immediate onset of right wrist pain and deformity.  Prehospital care consisted of immobilization with a sling by EMS.  She reports no loss of consciousness.  Past medical history is significant for hypertension, well-controlled with Lisinopril.  Surgical history is unremarkable.  She denies any known drug allergies.  She reports numbness and tingling in the right thumb, index, and middle fingers.  The injury involves the right distal radius and wrist.  Radiographs demonstrate a Type C distal radius fracture and evidence of scapholunate ligament disruption.  Nerve conduction studies are pending.\",\n    \"objective\": \"Alert and oriented.  Right wrist is swollen and deformed.  Radial pulse palpable.  Capillary refill brisk.  Sensory examination reveals decreased sensation in the right median nerve distribution.  Motor examination shows mild weakness in right thumb opposition.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation.  No respiratory distress.\",\n    \"assessment\": \"This patient presents with a complex right wrist injury.  The following diagnoses are made:\\n1. Type C distal radius fracture (S00.00XA)\\n2.
