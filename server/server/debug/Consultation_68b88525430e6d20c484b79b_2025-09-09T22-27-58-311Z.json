Clinical examination reveals tenderness to palpation over the distal radius, with significant swelling and deformity.  There is decreased range of motion in the right wrist.  Sensory examination reveals slightly diminished sensation in the median nerve distribution of the right hand, suggesting possible neuropraxia.  Scapholunate ligament injury is suspected based on clinical findings and will require further imaging confirmation.  Prophylactic antibiotics (Cephalexin) have been prescribed to minimize the risk of infection.  A sugar tong splint has been applied for immobilization.  Occupational and physical therapy have been ordered to commence post-operatively.  Patient will be scheduled for further imaging and potential surgical intervention.\"\n  },\n  \"clinicalSections\": {\n    \"chiefComplaint\": \"Right wrist pain and deformity following a fall.\",\n    \"hpi\": \"A 55-year-old female patient, Jane Doe, presented to the clinic today, 10/09/2025, complaining of right wrist pain and deformity following a fall approximately 2 hours prior.
